      <h1>Lesson 2: Regulatory Frameworks</h1>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) and mobile applications, understanding regulatory frameworks is paramount for organizations seeking to ensure ethical data practices and protect user privacy. Various privacy regulations have been enacted worldwide to govern data collection, processing, and consent, providing a framework for responsible data management. This lesson explores key regulatory frameworks, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), along with the importance of legal and regulatory compliance in data consent.
      </p>

      <h2>Overview of AI and Privacy Regulations</h2>
      <h3>The Importance of Privacy Regulations</h3>
      <p>
        Privacy regulations are designed to protect individuals' personal data, ensuring that data consent mechanisms are clear, accessible, and technically feasible will be crucial to maintaining user rights and fostering ethical innovation. Organizations handle it responsibly and ethically. As technology advances, the collection and processing of vast amounts of personal data have become commonplace. Without regulatory oversight, individuals may be vulnerable to data breaches, misuse of information, and violations of their privacy rights. Regulatory frameworks address these concerns by establishing guidelines for data collection, consent, and processing, fostering trust between organizations and users.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Objectives of Privacy Regulations</h4>

      <h2>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
      <h3>Overview of GDPR</h3>
      <p>
        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection regulation enacted by the European Union (EU) in May 2018. It represents a significant shift in how organizations handle personal data, establishing strict requirements for data processing and user consent.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Principles of GDPR</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency:</b> Organizations must process personal data lawfully, fairly, and transparently. Users should be informed about how their data will be used and the legal basis for processing.</li>
        <li><b>Purpose Limitation:</b> Data should be collected for specified, legitimate purposes and not processed further in a manner incompatible with those purposes.</li>
        <li><b>Data Minimization:</b> Organizations should only collect personal data that is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed, reducing the risk of data overreach.</li>
        <li><b>Accuracy:</b> Organizations are responsible for ensuring that personal data is accurate and up-to-date.</li>
        <li><b>Storage Limitation:</b> Personal data should be retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill its purpose.</li>
