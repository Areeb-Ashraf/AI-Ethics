      <h2>Ethical Implications of Implied or Passive Consent</h2>
      <h4>Understanding Implied or Passive Consent</h4>
      <p>
        Implied or passive consent refers to situations where consent is not
        explicitly sought but is assumed based on user actions or behavior. For
        example, if a user downloads an app that includes terms of service that
        mention data collection, their consent may be considered implied.
      </p>

      <h4>Ethical Concerns Surrounding Implied or Passive Consent</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Lack of Clarity:</strong> Implied consent can lead to
          misunderstandings about what users are agreeing to. Users may not
          fully grasp the implications of their consent, raising ethical
          concerns about informed decision-making.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Autonomy:</strong> Implied consent undermines user
          autonomy by assuming agreement without explicit confirmation. This
          approach can lead to users feeling powerless regarding their data
          choices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Potential for Exploitation:</strong> Organizations may exploit
          implied consent to collect data without fully informing users of the
          extent of data usage. This can result in ethical dilemmas, especially
          in sensitive contexts.
        </li>
      </ul>
