          <strong>Early Models:</strong> Traditionally, accountability was associated with direct oversight and hierarchical 
          governance structures. Organizations operated under top-down management, where individuals were held responsible for 
          specific tasks and outcomes. This model was often personal and focused on individual actions, leading to a relatively 
          narrow understanding of accountability.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Digital Revolution:</strong> The rise of the internet and digital technologies initiated a shift toward more 
          decentralized models of accountability. Stakeholders began to recognize that technology could influence accountability 
          dynamics. With the democratization of information, accountability became a shared responsibility among users, developers, 
          and organizations. This shift highlighted the need for collaborative approaches to accountability in digital environments.
