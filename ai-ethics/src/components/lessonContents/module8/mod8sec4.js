            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</strong> This European Union regulation emphasizes data protection and privacy, indirectly promoting diversity by requiring organizations to consider the impact of their data practices on all individuals. It mandates transparency, user consent, and accountability in data handling, which can help address biases in AI systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</strong> The CCPA gives California residents greater control over their personal data, allowing them to know what data is being collected and how it is used. While not solely focused on diversity, it fosters inclusivity by ensuring that diverse user perspectives are considered in data collection and usage.
